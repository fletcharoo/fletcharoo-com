# Fletcher Cutting

_Hang on._ Is your website broken?

**Nope!** This is exactly how I want my website to look. Lightweight, accessible, no bullshit.

## About Me

From Melbourne, Australia, I'm a passionate and experienced software developer with a proven track record of successfully bringing greenfield projects to production.

I'm completely self-taught and always looking to solve challenging problems and learn new skills.
